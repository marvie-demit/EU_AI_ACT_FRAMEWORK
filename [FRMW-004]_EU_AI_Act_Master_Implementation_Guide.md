# The EU AI Act: A Master Implementation Guide

**A Comprehensive, Step-by-Step Framework for Compliance**


## Introduction

This Master Implementation Guide provides a complete, actionable framework for organizations seeking to comply with the European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689). Inspired by the WHO's Laboratory Quality Stepwise Implementation (LQSI) model, this guide breaks down the complex legal requirements into a series of manageable phases and granular activities.

### Framework Structure

The guide is structured into two parallel tracks:

**Track A: Risk-Based Implementation (For AI System Providers and Deployers)**
This track follows the risk-based approach of the AI Act, with progressively increasing compliance obligations.

*   **Phase 1: Foundational Governance & Minimal Risk Compliance (6 Activities)**
*   **Phase 2: Limited Risk Compliance (7 Activities)**
*   **Phase 3: High-Risk AI Compliance (10 Activities)**

**Track B: GPAI Parallel Track (For General-Purpose AI Model Providers)**
This track addresses the specific obligations for providers of GPAI models, which apply irrespective of the downstream risk level.

*   **GPAI Parallel Track (7 Activities)**

Each of the 30 activities in this guide is presented as a standalone module with a consistent structure:

1.  **Activity Summary:** A concise statement of the objective.
2.  **Activity Description:** Detailed explanation of the `Why`, `What`, `How`, and `Who`.
3.  **Supporting Materials:** Embedded, production-ready templates and links to relevant legal articles and standards.

## Activity 1.1: Establish AI Governance Body

**A Detailed Guide to Implementing Foundational AI Oversight**


### **1. Activity Summary**

Form a cross-functional team or committee responsible for overseeing AI compliance, risk management, and ethical guidelines across the organization.

### **2. Activity Description**

#### **Why should this activity be completed?**

Establishing a dedicated AI Governance Body is the cornerstone of a successful EU AI Act compliance program. Centralized oversight is critical for ensuring the consistent application of policies, managing complex risks, and demonstrating accountability to regulators. Without a formal governance structure, compliance efforts often become siloed, inefficient, and incomplete, leading to significant legal and financial risks. This body provides a single source of truth and authority for all AI-related matters, ensuring a holistic and strategic approach to AI adoption and risk management.

#### **What should be done?**

The primary output of this activity is a formally constituted AI Governance Body with a clear mandate and the authority to act. The key deliverables include:

1.  **AI Governance Body Charter:** A formal document defining the body's mission, scope, authority, responsibilities, and decision-making processes.
2.  **Defined Roles and Responsibilities:** A clear RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix outlining the duties of the chairperson, core members, and advisory members.
3.  **Official Member Roster:** A list of appointed individuals and the departments they represent.
4.  **Meeting Cadence and Agenda:** A defined schedule for regular meetings (e.g., quarterly) and a standing agenda covering key governance topics.

#### **How should it be completed?**

This activity should be completed in the following chronological order:

1.  **Secure Executive Sponsorship:** Identify a C-level executive (e.g., Chief Legal Officer, Chief Technology Officer, or Chief Compliance Officer) to champion the initiative and provide the necessary authority and resources.
2.  **Identify Key Stakeholder Departments:** Map out all departments that are involved in the development, deployment, or oversight of AI systems. This typically includes Legal, Compliance, Privacy, IT/Cybersecurity, Data Science/Engineering, HR, and representatives from key business units that use AI.
3.  **Draft the AI Governance Body Charter:** The executive sponsor, in collaboration with the legal and compliance leads, should draft a charter using the template provided in the Supporting Materials section.
4.  **Nominate and Appoint Members:** Based on the stakeholder map, department heads should nominate suitable representatives with the requisite expertise and seniority. The executive sponsor formally appoints the members.
5.  **Appoint a Chairperson:** Designate a chairperson to lead the body. This individual should have strong leadership skills and a deep understanding of both the business and the regulatory landscape.
6.  **Schedule and Conduct the Inaugural Meeting:** The first meeting should be used to formally ratify the charter, introduce the members, and set the agenda for the first 90 days. Key initial tasks will include approving the procedures for Activities 1.2 (AI Inventory) and 1.4 (Risk Classification).
7.  **Establish Communication Channels:** Define how the governance body will report its findings and decisions to executive leadership and how it will communicate policies and guidance across the organization.

#### **Who can best complete the activity?**

This is a cross-functional effort that requires senior leadership involvement:

*   **Executive Sponsor (Accountable):** A C-level leader who provides top-down authority.
*   **Chairperson (Responsible):** A senior leader, such as a Chief Compliance Officer, Chief Risk Officer, or a dedicated Chief AI Officer, who will lead the body's operations.
*   **Core Members:** Director-level or senior manager representatives from:
    *   Legal & Privacy
    *   Cybersecurity
    *   Data Science / AI Engineering
    *   IT / Infrastructure
    *   Key Business Units (e.g., Marketing, Operations, Finance)
    *   Human Resources (especially if AI is used in hiring)
*   **Advisors (Consulted):** Subject matter experts who can be called upon as needed, including external legal counsel, ethics advisors, and specialized consultants.

## Activity 1.2: Develop AI Inventory Procedure

**A Detailed Guide to Standardizing AI System Identification and Documentation**


### **1. Activity Summary**

Create a standardized, formal procedure for identifying, documenting, and maintaining a comprehensive register of all AI systems used or developed within the organization.

### **2. Activity Description**

#### **Why should this activity be completed?**

A standardized AI Inventory Procedure is the bedrock of compliance with the EU AI Act. Without a formal process, the identification of AI systems becomes ad-hoc and unreliable, making it impossible to create a complete inventory (Activity 1.3) or perform accurate risk classifications (Activity 1.5). This procedure ensures that all business units use a consistent method to report AI systems, providing the AI Governance Body with the necessary data to perform its oversight function. It transforms AI identification from a one-time project into a continuous, repeatable business process, which is essential for ongoing compliance and risk management.

#### **What should be done?**

The primary deliverable of this activity is a formally approved **AI System Inventory Procedure** document. This document will serve as the official guide for the entire organization. Key components of this procedure include:

1.  **A clear definition** of what constitutes an "AI system" within the context of the organization and the EU AI Act.
2.  **A standardized data collection mechanism**, typically an "AI System Identification Form" or questionnaire.
3.  **A defined workflow** for how the form is submitted, reviewed, and entered into the central AI inventory.
4.  **Clear roles and responsibilities** for who is responsible for identifying and reporting AI systems.

#### **How should it be completed?**

This activity should be completed in the following chronological order:

1.  **Assign Responsibility:** The AI Governance Body (established in Activity 1.1) should assign the task of drafting the procedure to a specific sub-group, typically led by representatives from IT, Data Science, and Compliance.
2.  **Define "AI System":** The sub-group must first establish a clear, practical definition of an "AI system" based on the EU AI Act (Article 3) to ensure everyone knows what needs to be reported. This definition should be included in the procedure document.
3.  **Design the Data Collection Form:** Using the template provided below, the sub-group should create a standardized "AI System Identification Form." This form is the core of the procedure and must capture all necessary information for the inventory and preliminary risk assessment.
4.  **Draft the Procedure Document:** The sub-group will draft the full procedure document, outlining the end-to-end process: how to access the form, who is required to fill it out, where to submit it, and the review and approval workflow.
5.  **Review and Refine:** The draft procedure and form should be circulated among the full AI Governance Body and a pilot group of business users for feedback to ensure clarity and practicality.
6.  **Formal Approval:** The final procedure document must be formally reviewed and approved by the AI Governance Body. This approval should be documented in the meeting minutes.
7.  **Communicate the Procedure:** Once approved, the procedure must be communicated to all relevant department heads and personnel across the organization.

#### **Who can best complete the activity?**

*   **AI Governance Body (Accountable):** Owns the final approval and is accountable for the procedure's effectiveness.
*   **Drafting Sub-Group (Responsible):** A team led by representatives from IT, Data Science, and Compliance is responsible for drafting the procedure and the form.
*   **Department Heads (Consulted):** Key business unit leaders should be consulted during the drafting phase to ensure the procedure is practical for their teams.
*   **All Employees (Informed):** All employees should be made aware of the procedure and their potential responsibility to report AI systems.

## Activity 1.3: Conduct Initial AI System Inventory

**A Detailed Guide to Executing the Organization-Wide AI Census**


### **1. Activity Summary**

Execute the approved "AI System Inventory Procedure" to create a comprehensive register of all AI systems currently in use or development across the organization, populating the central AI System Inventory.

### **2. Activity Description**

#### **Why should this activity be completed?**

This activity operationalizes the procedure developed in Activity 1.2. It is the practical, hands-on effort to create the single source of truth for all AI within the organization. A complete and accurate inventory is not just a best practice; it is the foundational prerequisite for compliance with the EU AI Act. Without knowing what AI systems you have, you cannot assess their risk, apply the correct controls, or report to regulators. This initial census provides the essential data needed for all subsequent compliance activities, from risk classification (Phase 1) to post-market monitoring (Phase 3).

#### **What should be done?**

The primary deliverable is the **Initial Populated AI System Inventory**. This is a living document, typically a spreadsheet or database, that contains a detailed record for every AI system identified across the company. It is the central register that the AI Governance Body will manage and maintain. Each entry in the inventory should contain, at a minimum, the information collected from the "AI System Identification Form."

#### **How should it be completed?**

This activity should be completed in the following chronological order:

1.  **Official Launch Communication:** The Chairperson of the AI Governance Body sends a formal communication (using the email template below) to all department heads, officially launching the AI inventory initiative. This email should state the purpose, mandatory nature, deadline, and link to the procedure and identification form from Activity 1.2.
2.  **Cascade Information:** Department heads are responsible for cascading this information to their teams and identifying individuals ("System Champions") responsible for documenting the AI systems within their respective areas.
3.  **Data Collection:** The designated System Champions use the "AI System Identification Form" to document each AI system. This may involve collaborating with technical leads, product managers, and procurement specialists.
4.  **Submission and Tracking:** As forms are submitted, a designated administrator from the AI Governance Body tracks the submissions against a list of expected departments to ensure full participation. They should follow up with any non-responsive departments.
5.  **Review for Completeness:** The AI Governance Body (or its designated sub-group) reviews each submitted form for clarity and completeness. If information is missing or unclear, the form is returned to the submitter with a request for clarification.
6.  **Populate the Central Inventory:** Once a submission is approved as complete, the information is formally entered as a new record in the central "AI System Inventory Register" (using the template below).
7.  **Report on Progress:** The AI Governance Body provides regular status updates to the Executive Sponsor on the progress of the inventory, highlighting any challenges or roadblocks.
8.  **Formal Closure:** Once the deadline is reached and all departments have been accounted for, the AI Governance Body formally closes the *initial* inventory phase and presents a summary report to executive leadership.

#### **Who can best complete the activity?**

*   **AI Governance Body (Accountable):** Owns the overall success of the inventory process and is accountable for the final, populated register.
*   **Department Heads & System Owners (Responsible):** Responsible for ensuring their teams identify and accurately document all AI systems using the provided form.
*   **IT / Data Science Teams (Consulted):** Can be consulted by business units to help identify embedded AI components in existing software or to clarify technical details.
*   **Executive Sponsor (Informed):** Kept informed of the progress and results of the inventory.

This procedure is the analytical engine of your entire compliance program. The EU AI Act is built on a risk-based approach, and accurately classifying each AI system is the most critical step in determining your legal obligations. An incorrect classification can lead to significant non-compliance (if a high-risk system is classified as low-risk) or unnecessary over-compliance and expense (if a low-risk system is classified as high-risk). A formal, documented procedure ensures that classifications are consistent, defensible, and based on a clear interpretation of the law, providing an essential audit trail for regulators.

#### **What should be done?**

The primary deliverable is a formally approved **AI Risk Classification Procedure** document. This document will contain:

1.  **A clear, sequential decision-making framework** (typically a flowchart or decision tree) that maps directly to the criteria in the EU AI Act.
2.  **Definitions** of each risk category, with examples.
3.  **A defined workflow** for how classifications are proposed, reviewed, and formally approved.
4.  **Clear roles and responsibilities** for who performs the classification and who approves it.

#### **How should it be completed?**

This activity is led by the Legal/Compliance team, with input from technical experts.

1.  **Assign Responsibility:** The AI Governance Body assigns the Legal/Compliance lead to draft the procedure.
2.  **Legal Interpretation:** The Legal lead performs a detailed analysis of Articles 5, 6, 52, and Annexes II and III of the EU AI Act to understand the precise legal criteria for each risk tier.
3.  **Draft the Decision Tree:** Based on the legal analysis, the lead drafts a sequential decision tree. The logic must flow from highest risk to lowest (Unacceptable -> High -> Limited -> Minimal) to prevent misclassification.
4.  **Draft the Full Procedure:** The lead drafts the full procedure document, wrapping the decision tree in a formal process for application, review, and approval.
5.  **Technical and Business Review:** The draft procedure is reviewed by the AI Governance Body, with specific feedback sought from technical (Data Science, Engineering) and business stakeholders to ensure the criteria are understandable and can be practically applied.
6.  **Validation with Test Cases:** The procedure should be tested against a few sample AI systems from the inventory to ensure it produces the expected classifications.
7.  **Formal Approval:** The final procedure is formally approved by the AI Governance Body and becomes the official methodology for the organization.

#### **Who can best complete the activity?**

*   **AI Governance Body (Accountable):** Accountable for approving the final procedure and ensuring its correct application.
*   **Legal/Compliance Lead (Responsible):** Responsible for interpreting the law and drafting the procedure and decision tree.
*   **Data Science / Technical Leads (Consulted):** Provide input on the technical feasibility and interpretation of the criteria.
*   **System Owners / Business Units (Informed):** Will be the primary users of this procedure to classify their systems in the next activity.

# [Your Company Name] AI Risk Classification Procedure

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Date]
**Owner:** AI Governance Body

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the official procedure for classifying all AI systems at [Your Company Name] according to the risk-based framework of the EU AI Act.

## 2. Scope

This procedure applies to all AI systems listed in the company's AI System Inventory.

## 3. Procedure

For each AI system, the System Owner, in consultation with Legal/Compliance, will follow the **AI Risk Classification Decision Tree** (Appendix A) to determine the risk classification. The final classification must be documented in the **AI Risk Classification Justification Form** and approved by the AI Governance Body before being recorded in the AI System Inventory.
