**Subject: Mandatory Action: Company-Wide AI System Inventory for EU AI Act Compliance**

Dear Department Heads,

As you know, [Your Company Name] is committed to the ethical and legal use of Artificial Intelligence. In preparation for the upcoming enforcement of the European Union’s AI Act, we are conducting a mandatory, company-wide inventory of all AI systems.

This initiative is being led by the AI Governance Body and has the full support of our executive leadership. A complete and accurate inventory is the critical first step in our compliance program.

**Action Required:**

You are required to ensure that all AI systems used or developed within your department are identified and documented. Please cascade this instruction to your teams and appoint individuals to carry out this task.

1.  **Review the Procedure:** Familiarize yourself with the official **AI System Inventory Procedure** here: [Link to Procedure Document from Activity 1.2]
2.  **Document Each System:** For each AI system, your team must complete the **AI System Identification Form** here: [Link to Online Form]

**Deadline:**

Please ensure all forms for your department are submitted by **[Date - e.g., 4 weeks from launch]**.

Failure to inventory a system may result in significant legal risk for the company. The AI Governance Body will be tracking submissions and will follow up with you directly.

Thank you for your immediate attention and cooperation in this critical compliance effort.

Best regards,

[Name of Chairperson]
