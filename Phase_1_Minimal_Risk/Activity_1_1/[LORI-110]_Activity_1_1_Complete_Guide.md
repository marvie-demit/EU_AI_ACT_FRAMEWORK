### Key Deliverables
1. **AI Governance Body Charter** - Formal document defining mission, scope, and authority
2. **RACI Matrix** - Clear role assignments and decision-making authority
3. **Member Roster** - Official list of appointed members with contact information
4. **Meeting Schedule** - Defined cadence and standing agenda
5. **Governance Meeting Minutes Template** - Standardized documentation format

### Success Criteria
- ✅ Charter approved by C-level executive sponsor
- ✅ All core member positions filled with appropriate seniority
- ✅ Inaugural meeting conducted with quorum present
- ✅ Meeting schedule established for next 12 months
- ✅ Communication channels to executive leadership defined

## 4. Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Pitfall 1: Insufficient Executive Sponsorship
**Problem:** Governance body lacks authority to enforce decisions or allocate resources.

**Consequences:**
- Recommendations ignored by business units
- Unable to halt non-compliant AI systems
- Compliance activities deprioritized

**Mitigation:**
- Secure C-level sponsor, not just director-level
- Include explicit authority in charter (veto power, budget control)
- Ensure sponsor actively participates in key meetings
- Establish direct reporting line to CEO or Board

---

### Pitfall 2: Wrong Members Appointed
**Problem:** Members lack seniority, expertise, or time to fulfill responsibilities.

**Consequences:**
- Decisions lack credibility or enforceability
- Technical assessments are superficial
- Meetings become ineffective

**Mitigation:**
- Set minimum seniority requirements (Director-level or above)
- Verify technical expertise through interviews
- Confirm time commitment upfront (4-8 hours per quarter minimum)
- Include job responsibilities in performance evaluations
- Rotate members if they become disengaged

---

### Pitfall 3: Overly Bureaucratic Process
**Problem:** Governance becomes a bottleneck that slows innovation.

**Consequences:**
- Business units circumvent governance to move faster
- Shadow AI systems deployed without oversight
- Governance body loses credibility

**Mitigation:**
- Implement tiered review process (fast-track for low-risk systems)
- Set clear SLAs for review timelines (e.g., 2 weeks for risk classification)
- Delegate routine decisions to working groups
- Focus governance body on strategic and high-risk decisions only
- Provide clear guidance documents to reduce back-and-forth

---

### Pitfall 4: Lack of Technical Expertise
**Problem:** Governance body cannot effectively assess AI risks due to insufficient technical knowledge.

**Consequences:**
- Risks overlooked or misclassified
- Ineffective risk mitigation measures
- Inability to challenge vendor claims

**Mitigation:**
- Include senior data scientists/AI engineers as core members
- Engage external technical advisors for complex systems
- Provide AI literacy training for non-technical members
- Establish technical working groups for deep-dive assessments
- Require technical documentation in accessible language

---

### Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Meeting Cadence
**Problem:** Meetings cancelled or rescheduled frequently, losing momentum.

**Consequences:**
- Compliance activities stall
- Members become disengaged
- Regulatory deadlines missed

**Mitigation:**
- Schedule all meetings for the year in advance
- Make attendance mandatory (in job descriptions)
- Set minimum quorum requirements
- Record meetings for absent members
- Assign a dedicated meeting coordinator

---

### Pitfall 6: Poor Documentation
**Problem:** Decisions not properly recorded, leading to confusion and lack of audit trail.

**Consequences:**
- Inability to demonstrate compliance to regulators
- Decisions reversed or forgotten
- Disputes over what was agreed

**Mitigation:**
- Use standardized meeting minutes template ([LORI-113])
- Assign dedicated note-taker for each meeting
- Distribute minutes within 48 hours
- Maintain centralized document repository
- Implement version control for all governance documents
- Retain records for minimum 10 years

## 5. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Financial Services Company
**Context:** Mid-sized bank deploying AI for credit scoring (High-Risk system)

**Governance Body Structure:**
- **Executive Sponsor:** Chief Risk Officer
- **Chairperson:** Head of Regulatory Compliance
- **Core Members:**
  - General Counsel (Legal)
  - Chief Information Security Officer (Cybersecurity)
  - Head of Data Science (Technical)
  - Head of Retail Banking (Business)
  - Data Protection Officer (Privacy)
  - Head of Internal Audit (QMS)

**Meeting Cadence:** Monthly (due to High-Risk system)

**Key Success Factor:** CRO's active involvement ensured governance decisions were taken seriously across the organization. Technical expertise from Head of Data Science enabled effective risk assessment.

---

### Example 2: Healthcare Technology Startup
**Context:** Small company (50 employees) developing AI diagnostic tool (High-Risk system)

**Governance Body Structure:**
- **Executive Sponsor:** CEO
- **Chairperson:** Chief Medical Officer
- **Core Members:**
  - VP Engineering (Technical)
  - Legal Counsel (external advisor)
  - Clinical Affairs Manager (Regulatory)
  - Quality Assurance Manager (QMS)

**Meeting Cadence:** Bi-weekly (due to fast development pace)

**Key Success Factor:** CEO's direct involvement as sponsor ensured rapid decision-making. External legal counsel provided EU AI Act expertise the small team lacked.

---

### Example 3: E-commerce Platform
**Context:** Large online retailer using AI for product recommendations (Minimal Risk)

**Governance Body Structure:**
- **Executive Sponsor:** Chief Technology Officer
- **Chairperson:** VP of Legal & Compliance
- **Core Members:**
  - VP of Data Science (Technical)
  - Chief Privacy Officer (Privacy)
  - VP of Product (Business)
  - Head of Cybersecurity (Security)

**Meeting Cadence:** Quarterly

**Key Success Factor:** Clear scope definition prevented governance body from being overwhelmed with low-risk systems. Fast-track approval process for minimal-risk AI enabled innovation while maintaining oversight.
