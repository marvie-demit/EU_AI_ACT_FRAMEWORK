# Activity 1.6: Draft and Adopt Voluntary Code of Conduct

**Phase:** 1 - Foundational Governance & Minimal Risk Compliance  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-4 weeks  
**Complexity:** Low  
**Prerequisites:** Activity 1.1 (AI Governance Body established)

---

## 1. Activity Overview

### Purpose
Develop and adopt voluntary AI principles and commitments that go beyond minimum legal requirements, demonstrating responsible AI leadership.

### Why This Matters
Article 95 encourages voluntary codes of conduct for non-High-Risk systems. This demonstrates proactive governance, builds stakeholder trust, and prepares for potential future regulations. Many customers and partners now require AI ethics commitments.

### Key Deliverables
- AI Code of Conduct / Responsible AI Principles document ([LORI-161])

---

## 2. Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Review Existing Frameworks (Week 1)
- OECD AI Principles
- EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI
- Industry-specific codes (if available)
- Competitor/peer codes of conduct

### Task 2: Draft Principles (Week 1-2)
- Use template [LORI-161] as starting point
- Typical principles: Fairness, Transparency, Accountability, Privacy, Safety, Human Oversight
- Customize to your organization's values and risk profile
- Make principles specific and actionable, not just aspirational

### Task 3: Socialize and Refine (Week 2-3)
- Share draft with stakeholders (technical teams, legal, business units)
- Gather feedback
- Ensure principles are realistic and achievable

### Task 4: Adopt and Communicate (Week 3-4)
- AI Governance Body formally adopts code
- Executive sponsor endorses publicly
- Publish on website and in contracts
- Train employees on principles

## 3. Common Pitfalls and Mitigation

### Pitfall: Principles Without Teeth
**Problem:** Beautiful principles document that nobody follows.

**Mitigation:**
- Include specific commitments (e.g., "We will conduct bias testing on all customer-facing AI")
- Assign accountability for each principle
- Include principles in AI system approval process
- Report on adherence annually

---

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Tech Startup
**Principles Adopted:**
1. Transparency: We disclose when AI is used in customer interactions
2. Fairness: We test for demographic bias before deployment
3. Human Oversight: Humans can override AI decisions
4. Privacy: We minimize data collection and provide opt-outs
5. Accountability: We have a designated AI Ethics Officer

**Implementation:** Each principle linked to specific process requirements in system approval workflow.
