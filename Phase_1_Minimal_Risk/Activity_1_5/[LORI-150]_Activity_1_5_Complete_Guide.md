# Activity 1.5: Classify All Inventoried Systems

**Phase:** 1 - Foundational Governance & Minimal Risk Compliance  
**Estimated Duration:** 3-6 weeks  
**Complexity:** High  
**Prerequisites:** Activities 1.3 and 1.4 completed

---

## 1. Activity Overview

### Purpose
Apply the risk classification procedure to all systems in the inventory, documenting the rationale for each classification decision.

### Why This Matters
This activity determines your compliance roadmap. High-Risk systems require extensive controls (Activities 3.1-3.10). Limited Risk systems need transparency measures (Activities 2.1-2.7). Minimal Risk systems have voluntary obligations only.

### Key Deliverables
- Completed Risk Classification Justification Forms for each system ([LORI-151])
- Updated AI System Inventory Register with risk classifications ([LORI-152])
- AI Risk Distribution Report ([LORI-153])

---

## 2. Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Assign Classification Responsibilities (Week 1)
- System owners complete initial classification using procedure from Activity 1.4
- AI Governance Body reviews and approves all classifications
- Legal counsel consulted for borderline High-Risk cases

### Task 2: Classify Systems in Batches (Week 1-4)
- Start with obvious cases (customer chatbots → Limited Risk)
- Then tackle complex cases (systems that might be High-Risk)
- Use template [LORI-151] to document rationale for each system
- Schedule governance body review sessions (2-3 hours each)

### Task 3: Handle Disputed Classifications (Week 3-5)
- Some classifications will be unclear or disputed
- Escalate to legal counsel
- Document assumptions and reasoning
- When in doubt, classify higher (easier to downgrade than upgrade)

### Task 4: Update Inventory and Generate Report (Week 5-6)
- Transfer approved classifications to inventory register [LORI-152]
- Generate risk distribution report [LORI-153]
- Present findings to executive leadership
- Plan resource allocation based on High-Risk system count

## 3. Common Pitfalls and Mitigation

### Pitfall 1: Wishful Thinking
**Problem:** Classifying systems as lower risk than they are to avoid compliance burden.

**Consequences:** Regulatory violations, fines, reputational damage.

**Mitigation:** When uncertain, classify higher. Get external legal opinion for High-Risk determinations. Remember: regulators will review your classifications.

---

### Pitfall 2: Inconsistent Application
**Problem:** Similar systems classified differently.

**Example:** Two recruitment screening tools, one classified High-Risk, one Minimal Risk.

**Mitigation:** Use standardized classification form for all systems. Have same reviewers assess similar systems. Document why seemingly similar systems differ.

## 4. Practical Examples

### Example: Financial Services Firm
**Total Systems:** 23  
**Classification Results:**
- Unacceptable Risk: 0
- High-Risk: 3 (credit scoring, fraud detection for loan decisions, automated trading risk assessment)
- Limited Risk: 2 (customer service chatbot, marketing email personalization with AI-generated content)
- Minimal Risk: 18 (internal analytics, forecasting tools, process automation)

**Key Decision:** Fraud detection was debated. Classified as High-Risk because it directly impacts access to financial services (Annex III, point 5(b)).

**Resource Impact:** 3 High-Risk systems required full Phase 3 compliance (Activities 3.1-3.10), estimated 12-18 months and €500K-1M total investment.

## 6. Next Steps

Based on classification results: (1) If High-Risk systems: Proceed to Phase 3 (Activities 3.1-3.10), (2) If Limited Risk systems: Proceed to Phase 2 (Activities 2.1-2.7), (3) If only Minimal Risk: Proceed to Activity 1.6 (Voluntary Code of Conduct)
