**Inventory ID:** [e.g., AI-001]
**System Owner:** [Name, Department]
**Date of Assessment:** [Date]

## 1. Proposed Classification

**Final Proposed Classification:** [Select one: Unacceptable / High / Limited / Minimal]

## 2. Justification based on Decision Tree

*(Document the path taken through the AI Risk Classification Decision Tree from Activity 1.4)*

**Step 1: Unacceptable Risk Assessment**
*   Did the system meet any criteria for Unacceptable Risk? **[Yes/No]**
*   *Justification:* [Provide a brief explanation. e.g., "The system does not use subliminal techniques, exploit vulnerabilities, perform social scoring, or conduct real-time biometric identification for law enforcement."]

**Step 2: High-Risk Assessment**
*   Is the system a safety component of a product listed in Annex II? **[Yes/No]**
*   Does the system fall into one of the specific high-risk areas in Annex III? **[Yes/No]**
    *   If Yes, which one(s)? [e.g., "Employment, workers management..."]
*   Does the system pose a significant risk of harm to health, safety, or fundamental rights? **[Yes/No]**
*   *Justification:* [Provide a detailed explanation. e.g., "The system is used for recruitment (Annex III, point 4) and makes decisions that significantly impact a person's access to employment, thus it is classified as High-Risk."]

**Step 3: Limited Risk Assessment**
*   Did the system meet any criteria for Limited Risk? **[Yes/No]**
*   *Justification:* [e.g., "N/A, as the system was already classified as High-Risk."] OR [e.g., "Yes, the system is a chatbot that interacts directly with users, therefore it meets the criteria for Limited Risk."]

**Step 4: Minimal Risk Assessment**
*   Was the system classified as Minimal Risk by default? **[Yes/No]**
*   *Justification:* [e.g., "The system is an internal tool for summarizing news articles and does not meet any criteria for Unacceptable, High, or Limited risk, therefore it defaults to Minimal Risk."]
