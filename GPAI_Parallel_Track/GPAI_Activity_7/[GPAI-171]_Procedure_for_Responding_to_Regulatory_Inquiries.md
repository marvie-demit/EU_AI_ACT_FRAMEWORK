# Procedure for Responding to Regulatory Inquiries

**Version 1.0 | Effective Date: [Date]**

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This procedure outlines the official process for managing all inquiries and requests from the EU AI Office and national competent authorities related to our obligations under the EU AI Act. Its purpose is to ensure timely, accurate, and complete responses.

## 2. Procedure Steps

**Step 1: Intake and Logging**
*   All requests received via any channel (email, post, official portal) must be immediately forwarded to the designated Legal/Compliance Lead.
*   The Lead logs the request in the **Regulatory Inquiry Log** within 24 hours of receipt, assigning it a unique tracking ID.

**Step 2: Initial Assessment (Triage)**
*   The Lead assesses the request to understand its nature, scope, and deadline.
*   The Lead identifies the relevant internal stakeholders (e.g., Model Owner, Head of Data Engineering) required to fulfill the request.

**Step 3: Information Gathering**
*   The Lead coordinates with the identified stakeholders to gather all necessary information and documentation (e.g., technical documentation, test results, risk assessments).
*   All gathered materials are stored in a dedicated, access-controlled folder corresponding to the tracking ID.

**Step 4: Draft Response**
*   The Lead drafts a formal response, ensuring it directly addresses all parts of the authority's request.
*   The draft response and all supporting documentation are compiled into a single package.

**Step 5: Internal Review and Approval**
*   The draft response package is reviewed by the AI Governance Body for accuracy and completeness.
*   For significant inquiries, final approval from Executive Leadership may be required.

**Step 6: Submission**
*   The Lead submits the final, approved response to the authority via the requested channel before the specified deadline.
*   The date and method of submission are recorded in the Regulatory Inquiry Log.

**Step 7: Closure**
*   The inquiry is marked as "Closed" in the log once the authority has acknowledged receipt or confirmed the matter is resolved.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **Legal/Compliance Lead:** Manages the end-to-end process.
*   **AI Governance Body:** Provides oversight and final review.
*   **Technical Stakeholders:** Provide required information.
