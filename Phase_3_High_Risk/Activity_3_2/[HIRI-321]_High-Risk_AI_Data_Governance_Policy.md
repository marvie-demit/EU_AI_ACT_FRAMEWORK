# [Your Company Name] High-Risk AI Data Governance Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** [Date]
**Owner:** AI Governance Body

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the mandatory data governance framework required by Article 10 of the EU AI Act. This policy ensures that the training, validation, and testing data for all High-Risk AI systems are relevant, representative, accurate, complete, and free of unjust bias.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all datasets used in the lifecycle of any AI system classified as High-Risk.

## 3. Data Governance Principles

All datasets must be managed according to the following principles:

*   **Relevance & Representativeness:** Data must be relevant and sufficiently representative in view of the system's intended purpose.
*   **Accuracy & Completeness:** Data must be accurate, correct, and complete.
*   **Bias Detection & Mitigation:** Data must be examined for, and managed to prevent, the reinforcement of discrimination.
*   **Provenance & Traceability:** The origin and lifecycle of all data must be documented.

## 4. Process

For every dataset used by a High-Risk AI system, a **Data Sheet** must be completed, reviewed, and approved before the dataset is used for model training or testing. The Data Sheet serves as the primary record of compliance with this policy.

## 5. Roles and Responsibilities

*   **AI Governance Body:** Oversees this policy and approves all Data Sheets.
*   **System Owner / Data Science Team:** Responsible for completing the Data Sheet for each dataset they use.
*   **Data Governance Officer:** Provides guidance and maintains the central repository of approved Data Sheets.
