# High-Risk AI - Serious Incident Reporting Procedure

## 1. Purpose

This procedure defines the process for identifying, investigating, and reporting serious incidents related to High-Risk AI systems to the relevant national market surveillance authorities, as required by Article 73 of the EU AI Act.

## 2. Definition of a Serious Incident

A "serious incident" is any incident that results, directly or indirectly, in any of the following:

*   The death of a person or serious damage to a person’s health.
*   A serious disruption of the management and operation of critical infrastructure.
*   Serious damage to property or the environment.

## 3. Reporting Timelines

*   **Immediately, and in any event not later than 15 days** after the provider becomes aware of the incident.
*   **Immediately, and in any event not later than 2 days** if there is a serious public health threat.

## 4. Procedure

1.  **Initial Detection:** Any employee who becomes aware of a potential serious incident must immediately report it to the AI Governance Body.
2.  **Initial Assessment (Triage):** The AI Governance Body, led by the Legal/Compliance representative, performs an initial assessment within 24 hours to determine if the event qualifies as a serious incident.
3.  **Investigation:** If it is a serious incident, a formal investigation is launched, led by the System Owner.
4.  **Notification to Authorities:** The Legal/Compliance lead submits the initial notification to the relevant national authority via the designated portal, within the legal timeframe.
5.  **Final Report:** A final, detailed report is submitted to the authority following the conclusion of the investigation.
