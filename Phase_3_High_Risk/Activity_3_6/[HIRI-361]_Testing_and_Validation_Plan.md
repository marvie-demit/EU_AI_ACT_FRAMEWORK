**Source:** Activity_3_6


*(A document to be completed for each High-Risk AI system before testing begins)*

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **System Name / ID:** | [e.g., Credit Scoring Model / AI-007] |
| **Test Lead:** | [Name] |
| **Version:** | 1.0 |

| **1. Accuracy Testing** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Metrics:** | [e.g., Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC] |
| **Acceptance Criteria:** | [e.g., "F1-Score must be > 0.90 on the holdout test set."] |
| **Test Dataset:** | [e.g., "Q4 2025 Holdout Dataset (see Data Sheet XYZ)"] |

| **2. Robustness Testing** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Methods:** | [e.g., "Adversarial testing using FGSM method," "Testing with noisy data (10% random noise injection)," "Testing with edge cases (e.g., zero-value inputs)."] |
| **Acceptance Criteria:** | [e.g., "System must not crash and must fail gracefully with a clear error message on all robustness tests."] |

| **3. Cybersecurity Testing** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Methods:** | [e.g., "External penetration testing by a third-party vendor," "Vulnerability scanning of all system components," "Testing for susceptibility to data poisoning and model inversion attacks."] |
| **Acceptance Criteria:** | [e.g., "No ‘Critical’ or ‘High’ vulnerabilities as defined by CVSS v3.1. All ‘Medium’ vulnerabilities must have a documented remediation plan."] |

| **4. Schedule & Resources** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Planned Start Date:** | [Date] |
| **Planned End Date:** | [Date] |
| **Testing Team:** | [List of team members and roles] |
