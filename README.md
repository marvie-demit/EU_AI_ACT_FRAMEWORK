# EU AI Act Compliance Framework

**A Complete Collection of Production-Ready Templates and Implementation Guides for EU AI Act Compliance**

---

## Overview

The EU AI Act Compliance Framework provides a comprehensive, stepwise implementation approach for organizations seeking compliance with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 (EU AI Act). This framework contains production-ready templates, detailed activity guides, and supporting materials organized by risk level and implementation phase.

**Framework Contents:**
- **118 documents** including activity guides, templates, and master references
- **Comprehensive ID system** for easy navigation and traceability
- **Author attribution** on all documents (Dipl. Ing. Marvie Demit)
- **Progressive compliance approach** from Minimal Risk to High-Risk AI systems
- **Parallel GPAI track** for General Purpose AI model providers
- **Enhanced activity guides** with practical implementation tasks, checklists, and pitfalls
- **Separate templates** to eliminate duplication and enable reuse

All materials are organized by implementation phase and activity, following the risk-based approach mandated by the EU AI Act.

---

## Document ID System

The framework uses a structured ID system for easy reference and traceability:

| Prefix | Category | ID Range |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **FRMW** | Framework/Master Documents | 001-099 |
| **LORI** | Low/Minimal Risk | 100-199 |
| **LIRI** | Limited Risk | 200-299 |
| **HIRI** | High Risk | 300-499 |
| **GPAI** | General Purpose AI | 100-199 |

**Example:** `[HIRI-311]_AI_Risk_Management_Policy.md` indicates a High-Risk AI template (ID 311) for the AI Risk Management Policy.
