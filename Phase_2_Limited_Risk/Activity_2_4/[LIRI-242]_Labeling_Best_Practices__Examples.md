# Labeling Best Practices & Examples

**Source:** Activity_2_4


The goal is a disclosure that is clear and persistent, but not overly intrusive.

**Key Principles:**
*   **Clarity:** The disclosure must be easy to understand.
*   **Persistence:** The disclosure should be difficult to remove. For images and video, a visible mark is preferred. For all content, a metadata tag (like C2PA) is a robust solution.
*   **Appropriateness:** The method should be appropriate for the content type.

**Good Examples by Content Type:**

*   **For AI-Generated Images:**
    *   **Visible Label:** A small, legible text overlay in a corner of the image stating "Generated by AI" or "AI-Generated Image."
    *   **Visible Symbol:** A universally recognized symbol for AI (though standards are still emerging).
    *   **Metadata:** Embedding a C2PA (Content Credentials) manifest in the image file. This is a robust, technical solution that acts as a digital birth certificate for the content.

*   **For AI-Generated Audio (e.g., synthetic voices):**
    *   **Audible Statement:** A brief, clear statement at the beginning or end of the audio, such as "This audio was generated using artificial intelligence."
    *   **In-audible Watermark:** A technical watermark that can be detected by software but is not audible to the human ear.

*   **For AI-Generated Video (e.g., deepfakes, avatars):**
    *   **Visible Watermark:** A persistent, semi-transparent watermark in a corner of the video frame (e.g., "AI-Generated").
    *   **Intro/Outro Slate:** A brief slate at the beginning or end of the video disclosing the use of AI.
    *   **Metadata:** Embedding a C2PA manifest in the video file.
