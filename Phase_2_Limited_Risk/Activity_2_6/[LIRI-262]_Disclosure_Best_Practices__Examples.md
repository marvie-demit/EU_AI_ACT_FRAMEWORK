# Disclosure Best Practices & Examples

**Source:** Activity_2_6


The goal is explicit, informed, and freely given consent.

**Key Principles (The GDPR Standard):**
*   **Just-in-Time:** Present the disclosure immediately before the data is collected, not buried in a general privacy policy.
*   **Specific & Granular:** Explain exactly what data is being collected and for what purpose.
*   **Unambiguous:** Use clear language. Avoid bundling consent for multiple things.
*   **Freely Given:** The user must have a genuine choice. If they can't use the service without consenting, it may not be considered freely given (this requires legal analysis).
*   **Easy to Withdraw:** It must be as easy to withdraw consent as it is to give it.

**Good Examples:**

*   **For an Emotion Recognition System (e.g., analyzing video calls):**
    *   **A pop-up modal before joining the call:**
        > **AI Engagement Analysis**
        > 
        > To help improve our training, this call will use an AI to analyze engagement by inferring emotions from facial expressions. This data will be visible only to the training team.
        > 
        > [ ] I understand and consent to the use of emotion recognition during this call.
        > 
        > `[Join Call]` (Button disabled until checkbox is ticked)

*   **For a Biometric Categorization System (e.g., face scanner for building access):**
    *   **A clear, physical sign at the point of entry:**
        > **NOTICE: AI-Powered Secure Access**
        > 
        > This entrance uses a facial recognition system to grant access. By proceeding, you are consenting to the use of your biometric data for security purposes.
        > 
        > For alternative access, please see reception.
