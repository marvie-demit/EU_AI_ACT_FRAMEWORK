# Notification Best Practices & Examples

**Source:** Activity_2_2


The goal is clarity, not legal jargon. The notification should be easy for a layperson to understand.

**Key Principles:**
*   **Be Upfront:** Display the notification at the beginning of the interaction.
*   **Be Clear:** Use simple language. Avoid terms like "Article 52 compliant."
*   **Be Concise:** Get the point across without overwhelming the user.
*   **Be Personable:** Match the tone of your brand.

**Good Examples:**

*   **For a Website Chatbot:**
    *   *(As the first message)* "Hi there! You're speaking with [Company Name]'s AI-powered assistant."
    *   *(In the text input box as placeholder text)* "Chat with our AI assistant..."
    *   *(A small, persistent banner at the top of the chat window)* "AI Assistant"

*   **For a Conversational IVR (Phone System):**
    *   *(As part of the initial greeting)* "Thanks for calling [Company Name]. You'll be speaking with our advanced AI assistant today."

*   **For a Virtual Assistant in an App:**
    *   *(On the welcome screen)* "Meet your new AI assistant, here to help you get started."

**Bad Examples (Avoid These):**

*   **Too technical:** "This interaction is powered by a machine learning algorithm."
*   **Hidden in terms of service:** Burying the notification in a long legal document is not sufficient.
*   **Too vague:** "Your experience may be automated."
