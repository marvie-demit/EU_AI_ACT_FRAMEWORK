**Subject: Action Required: EU AI Act Content Labeling Obligations for Your System - [System Name]**

Dear [System Owner Name],

Following the completion of our organization-wide AI risk classification, the AI Governance Body has formally classified the following system under your ownership as **Limited Risk** under the EU AI Act:

*   **System Name:** [System Name]
*   **Inventory ID:** [Inventory ID]

This classification is based on the system's capability to generate or manipulate image, audio, or video content. According to Article 52(3) of the EU AI Act, we are legally required to disclose that such content is artificially generated or manipulated.

**Action Required:**

You are now responsible for ensuring that this transparency requirement is implemented for your system. The next step in this process will be **Activity 2.4: Implement Content Labeling/Watermarking**, and the AI Governance Body will provide you with a detailed guide and support for this shortly.

Your system has been added to the **Limited-Risk Systems Register (Content Generation)**, and the target date for implementing this labeling is **[Target Implementation Date]**.

Please familiarize yourself with the legal requirement linked below. If you have any immediate questions or believe this classification is in error, please contact the AI Governance Body within 5 business days.

Thank you for your cooperation in this essential compliance task.

Best regards,

[Name of Chairperson]
Chairperson, AI Governance Body
